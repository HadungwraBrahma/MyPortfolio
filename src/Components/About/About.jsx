              I am a passionate Software Engineer and Full-Stack Developer with
              an MCA degree, specializing in building dynamic and scalable web
              applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React,
              Node.js) and Redux. I enjoy working across the entire development
              lifecycle, from designing responsive user interfaces to developing
              robust backend services.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a strong foundation in both frontend and backend
              technologies, I take pride in creating seamless, high-performance
              applications that meet usersâ€™ needs and business goals. I thrive
              on solving complex problems, optimizing code for scalability, and
              collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver exceptional
              products.
